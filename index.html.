        <h4>Meaning</h4>
        
        <p>Actually i can not say about the meaning of dream but depend on my exprence some dreams has direct meaning and some are opposite.example in eritrean culture if in your dream dress white cloth and dance it is very danger dream they belive in opposite that means you will die.shortly in your dream if you are happy in real life it is not good.so i think dreams are happens as your think.</p>
